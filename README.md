# belly-button-challenge

At first I was really stuck with this challenge. I wasn't used to having to do everything in a callback function, and the optionChanged function took me a while to get up and running too. That said, once I had figured it out for the bar chart, the rest was smooth sailing. 

One thing I want to note: When creating the drop-down menu options, I adapted some code I found here: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_select.html.

Other than that, I also had to do a bit of digging to find certain syntax for some things

Oh and I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the demographic data to line break in the webpage. I tried over and over but it always failed. No matter how I split the string in js, when I fed it into the html file it seemed to just ignore the line breaks
